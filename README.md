**MediaBuddy** is an open-source, self-hosted AI assistant. It's not just a tool — it's a digital life form that can operate in parallel. Through its multi-agent architecture, it builds an intelligent environment that is both independent and collaborative for teams, families, and individuals. Best of all, it runs entirely on your machine — the fully self-hosted design means privacy is never a compromise, while single-process startup makes the powerful web console, CLI, and IM integrations readily accessible.

Chat through the Web Dashboard, Feishu, DingTalk, QQ, WeChat, Telegram, Discord, WeCom, or programmatic HTTP/SSE/WebSocket. Extend capabilities with the **expert library**, **Connectors** (OAuth + MCP), and **ACP** integration for IDE workflows.

## 📌 Overview

MediaBuddy is a self-hosted AI assistant platform for households and small teams. It runs a single process that serves a web dashboard, a CLI, IM channels (Feishu, DingTalk, QQ, WeChat, Telegram, Discord, WeCom, and more), and cron automation — all sharing one control-plane database under `~/.octop/` (SQLite by default; PostgreSQL optional).

> MediaBuddy's design goal: keep every conversation, workspace, and credential on your own machine, while giving each user a personal team of specialized agents they can switch between per task.

<details>
<summary>🐾 What can you do with MediaBuddy</summary>

- **Personal assistant** — let a dedicated agent write weekly reports, organize notes, and manage your schedule; memory persists with the workspace.
- **Family sharing** — one admin account, the whole household; assign different agents and experts per member; share experts and knowledge bases when useful.
- **Team helper** — AgentTeams or parallel agents, bridging Feishu / DingTalk / WeCom / WeChat to route tasks into group chats.
- **Developer boost** — delegate coding tasks to OpenCode / Claude Code via ACP, or troubleshoot from the terminal with AI assistance.
- **Web automation** — use Browser AI+ and remote desktop for forms, screenshots, and GUI apps.
- **Scheduled tasks** — configure cron in natural language so the agent pushes or runs jobs on time every day.

</details>

## 🧠 Core Technology

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Language** | Python 3.12+ |
| **Web framework** | FastAPI + uvicorn |
| **Agent runtime** | [Octop Harness](https://github.com/TencentCloud/octop-harness) |
| **Gateway** | [Octop Gateway](https://github.com/TencentCloud/octop-gateway) |
| **Control plane DB** | SQLite (WAL, default) or PostgreSQL (optional) |
| **Frontend** | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Ant Design |
| **Scheduling** | APScheduler |
| **ACP** | agent-client-protocol |
| **Build / quality** | hatchling · ruff · mypy · pytest |

MediaBuddy is built on the Octop Harness stack — a set of focused runtimes that MediaBuddy composes into one process:

- **[Octop Harness](https://github.com/TencentCloud/octop-harness)** — Agent runtime: model routing, tools, skills, and conversation checkpointing.
- **[Octop Gateway](https://github.com/TencentCloud/octop-gateway)** — multi-platform IM channel bridge that normalizes incoming messages into a single processing pipeline.
- **[Octop Memory](https://github.com/TencentCloud/octop-memory)** — hierarchical recall with full-text search, so an agent's memory travels with its workspace.
- **[Octop Browser](https://github.com/TencentCloud/octop-browser)** — CDP-based browser automation with persistent profiles for web tasks.

Instead of an external queue or message broker, MediaBuddy routes every surface — Web UI, IM, and cron — through one in-process `HarnessProcessor`. The result is a single, restart-safe process whose entire state is rebuilt from the control-plane database on boot (local SQLite by default; PostgreSQL optional).

## 🤔 Features

### Server & auth
- Multi-user JWT authentication with admin role
- First-run setup wizard (`octop init`)
- Interactive API docs at `/api/docs` (off by default — set `"enable_api_docs": true` in `config.json` to enable)

### Experts
- Multiple experts per user; each has its own workspace, providers, channels, and cron
- 16 MBTI persona templates + custom system prompt
- Expert library scanned at boot (`infra/agents/experts/library/`); expert market and in-deployment expert sharing
- **AgentTeams** *(Beta)* — coordinator + member experts for multi-step tasks ([docs/expert-teams.md](docs/expert-teams.md))
- Workspace backends (expert files): local disk, Docker sandbox, PostgreSQL, COS/S3, and other remote stores — distinct from the control-plane database

### Channels & automation
- IM channels: Feishu, DingTalk, QQ, WeChat, Telegram, Discord, WeCom, and more
- Proactive cron jobs with natural-language and slash-command triggers
- Unified message processing across Web UI, IM, and cron surfaces

### Surfaces
- **Web dashboard** — chat, experts / teams, connectors, channels, cron, knowledge, plugins, settings
- **Desktop client** — native apps for Windows / macOS / Linux; FnOS packages for NAS
- **CLI** — `octop run`, `octop chats`, `octop acp`, admin commands
- **HTTP/SSE/WebSocket API** — full programmatic access
- **Remote desktop** — dashboard control of the host desktop session

### Knowledge & plugins
- **Knowledge base** — RAG over your documents; optional sharing within the same deployment
- **Plugins** — install and manage third-party plugins (`octop plugin`); bundled plugins are seeded and toggled on demand from the dashboard

### ACP (Agent Client Protocol)

MediaBuddy supports ACP in two directions:

1. **Inbound** — external tools use **your** MediaBuddy agent
   ```bash
   octop acp --agent main   # stdio ACP server for Zed, OpenCode, …
   ```

2. **Outbound** — MediaBuddy delegates to external coding agents
   - Dashboard → **ACP** (`/acp`): configure runners (global per user)
   - Enable **acp_runner** per agent, then delegate in chat

Built-in outbound runners include OpenCode, CodeBuddy, Claude Code, and Codex.

Full setup: **[docs/acp.md](docs/acp.md)**.

## 🧭 Roadmap

Here are our mid-to-long term plans:

**Shipped**
- [x] **Shared resource pool** — a central pool of skills and sub-agents that any user can drop into a new expert without rebuilding from scratch.
- [x] **Expert sharing** — publish your experts to other users in the same deployment, so good configurations are reused instead of recreated.
- [x] **PC client** — native desktop apps for Windows / macOS / Linux alongside the web dashboard and IM channels.

**In progress**
- [ ] **AgentTeams** *(Beta)* — let one coordinator autonomously schedule and orchestrate multiple experts to tackle multi-step tasks.
- [ ] **Mobile client** *(closed beta)* — native mobile apps currently in internal testing.

**Planned**
- [ ] **Browser & terminal polishing** — browser skill *recording* (capture a workflow and replay it as a skill) and a more capable terminal AI assistant.
- [ ] **Self-evolution** — automatically distill everyday conversations into reusable skills, so the assistant grows with you.
- [ ] **Managed Agents** — platform-hosted agent lifecycle (provision, scale, and operate agents without managing the full self-hosted stack yourself).
- [ ] **Project** — project-scoped workspaces that group agents, files, and conversations around a shared goal.
- [ ] **Cloud–edge continuum** — run MediaBuddy locally while offloading selected tasks to the cloud, so light work stays on-device and heavier jobs use remote capacity when you need it.
- [ ] **Plugin marketplace** — a curated market to discover, install, and update third-party plugins without leaving MediaBuddy.
- [ ] **Conversational control plane** — deepen MediaBuddy’s own skills so chat can cover the full dashboard surface: create experts, wire channels, manage knowledge bases, and scaffold plugins end-to-end.

This roadmap may shift as the community grows; treat it as indicative only.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **macOS / Linux / Windows**
- No pre-installed Python required — the installer uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to provision Python 3.12 in an isolated venv under `~/.octop/`
- A modern multi-core CPU with a few GB of RAM for the process plus model/embedding caches; enough disk for the database, agent workspaces, and document corpora

### 1. Install

**macOS / Linux** — one-line installer (recommended):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://finnie-1258344699.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/octop/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**:

```powershell
irm https://finnie-1258344699.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/octop/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Windows (cmd)** — download and run, or from a cloned repo:

```bat
curl -fsSL https://finnie-1258344699.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/octop/install.bat -o install.bat
install.bat
```

After installation, open a **new terminal** or reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc   # Zsh
# or
source ~/.bashrc  # Bash
```

The installer places `octop` on your PATH via `~/.octop/bin`. Optional extras:

```bash
# Download Playwright Chromium for browser automation (skipped if a system Chrome/Chromium is already present)
curl -fsSL https://finnie-1258344699.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/octop/install.sh | bash -s -- --extras browser
```

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for all install options (`--version`, `--from-source`, `--mirror`, Windows flags).

**Desktop app** (GUI, no terminal) — grab the artifact for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/TencentCloud/Octop/releases/latest):

| Platform | Artifact |
|----------|----------|
| Windows | `Octop-desktop-windows-amd64-<version>.exe` (64-bit) / `Octop-desktop-windows-arm64-<version>.exe` (ARM64) — NSIS installer |
| macOS | `Octop-desktop-darwin-arm64-<version>.dmg` (Apple Silicon) / `Octop-desktop-darwin-amd64-<version>.dmg` (Intel) |
| Linux | `Octop-desktop-linux-amd64-<version>.tar.gz` / `Octop-desktop-linux-arm64-<version>.tar.gz` |
| FnOS NAS | `Octop-fnos-docker-<version>.fpk` (Docker-backed) / `Octop-fnos-native-<version>.fpk` (no Docker) — install via App Center |

See [desktop/README.md](desktop/README.md) for the desktop shell and [fnos/README.md](fnos/README.md) for the FnOS packaging guide.

**Alternative — PyPI** (if you already manage Python yourself):

```bash
pip install octop
# optional local ONNX embedding model cache (Models → Local): pip install "octop[local-embedding]"
# Downloads catalog weights under ~/.octop/embedding_models; not chat, not Memory.
# Browser automation uses the bundled Playwright package; install Chromium via the installer --extras browser,
# the dashboard, or: python -m playwright install chromium
```

From a source checkout with uv:

```bash
uv sync --extra local-embedding
```

### 2. Initialize

```bash
octop init
```

The interactive wizard creates the SQLite database, JWT secret, and first admin account under `~/.octop/`.

### 3. Run

```bash
# Foreground (API + Web dashboard)
octop run

# Custom host / port
octop run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8088

# Register as a system service (systemd / launchd / Windows service)
octop service start
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8088**. With Docker, the first init generates a random admin password (written to `/data/.octop/credential.txt`) unless `OCTOP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` is set. Interactive `octop init` / the setup wizard asks you to choose a password (≥8 characters, letters and digits).

### Docker (recommended for production)

```bash
# Build and start
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Or build manually
bash docker/docker_build.sh
docker run -d \
  -p 8088:8088 \
  -v octop-data:/data/.octop \
  -e HOME=/data \
  -e OCTOP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD="<strong-password-or-omit-for-random>" \
  octop:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:8088`. First boot creates the admin account and writes the credentials to `/data/.octop/credential.txt` in the container. With `OCTOP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` unset a strong random password is generated; a password you set must be ≥8 characters with letters and digits (weak/common passwords are rejected by the app password policy and fall back to a random one). Override the username via `OCTOP_ADMIN_USERNAME`.

> **Password policy:** at least 8 characters with letters and digits.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OCTOP_PORT` | `8088` | HTTP listen port |
| `OCTOP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` | _(unset)_ | First-run admin password (Docker bootstrap). Unset = random password written to `credential.txt` |
| `OCTOP_ADMIN_USERNAME` | `admin` | First-run admin username |
| `OCTOP_DATA` | `~/.octop` | Host data directory (compose bind mount) |

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full list.

## 📦 Install options

| Method | Platform | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Remote one-liner | macOS / Linux | `curl …/octop/install.sh \| bash` |
| Remote one-liner | Windows | `irm …/octop/install.ps1 \| iex` or `install.bat` |
| Local script | macOS / Linux | `bash scripts/install.sh` |
| Local script | Windows | `scripts\install.bat` or `install.ps1` |
| PyPI | Any | `pip install octop` (optional extras such as `local-embedding`) |
| Docker | Any | `docker/docker-compose.yml` |

All install scripts provision an isolated environment at `~/.octop/venv` and a `~/.octop/bin/octop` wrapper — they do not touch system Python.

### Upgrade

`octop update` replaces only the wheel/binary — your `~/.octop/` database, workspaces, secrets, and `config.json` are preserved:

```bash
octop update          # fetch and install the latest octop, then restart the service if one is registered
```

The schema migrates automatically on next boot; run `octop init` only if the setup wizard prompts for a migration. Always back up first (`octop backup`) before a cross-version upgrade.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All runtime state lives in `~/.octop/`. Manage it via CLI or edit files directly.

```bash
# LLM providers and models
octop models
octop provider list

# IM channels
octop channel list
octop channel install

# Skills (per agent)
octop skills list --agent main

# Cron jobs
octop cron list
octop cron create --help

# Users (admin)
octop user list
```

### Supported LLM providers

OpenAI-compatible APIs, DashScope (Qwen), Ollama, and other presets — configure per agent in the dashboard or via `octop provider`.

### Supported channels

| Channel | Credentials |
|---------|-------------|
| **Feishu** | App ID, App Secret |
| **DingTalk** | App Key, App Secret |
| **QQ** | Bot AppID, Token |
| **WeChat** | QR bind / account credentials; [CLI](docs/cli.md) |
| **Telegram** | Bot Token |
| **Discord** | Bot Token; all accessible channels allowed by default, optional channel/DM allowlists; [setup and testing](docs/discord-channel.md) |
| **WeCom** | Corp ID, Agent Secret |
| **Web Dashboard** | Enabled by default |

Other kinds (e.g. Yuanbao, Xiaoyi, MQTT) are available via the gateway — see channel setup in the dashboard or CLI.

## 📖 CLI reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `octop init` | Bootstrap `~/.octop/` (DB, admin, JWT secret) |
| `octop run` | Start MediaBuddy in the foreground |
| `octop service start` | Install and start as a system service |
| `octop service stop` | Stop the system service |
| `octop agent` | Create, list, start/stop agents |
| `octop channel` | Install and manage IM channels |
| `octop chats` | REPL and session management |
| `octop acp` | Stdio ACP server for IDE integration |
| `octop cron` | Manage scheduled tasks |
| `octop models` | Provider presets and model resolution |
| `octop skills` | Enable/disable per-agent skills |
| `octop plugin` | Install and manage third-party plugins |
| `octop backup` | Export / restore backups |
| `octop clean` | Remove CLI state or wipe `~/.octop/` |
| `octop memory list` | List running agents eligible for memory maintenance; no database changes. |
| `octop memory slim [--agent ID]` | Back up and slim SQLite memory through the running host; uses the selected agent or prompts by number. Shows terminal and dashboard progress. [Details](docs/memory-slim.md) |
| `octop memory slim --all` | Sequentially maintain all eligible running agents, with per-agent progress; stops on the first failure. |
| `octop update` | Check for and install updates |

In signed-in dashboard or local CLI chat, `/memory slim` explains maintenance for the current agent;
`/memory slim --all` lists your eligible agents. Add `--confirm` to start after reviewing the impact.
Use `/memory status` for progress/results. Chat stays available until maintenance is confirmed and begins.
External IM maintenance requires verified sender permissions and is not enabled yet.

Full reference: **[docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md)**.

## 🖥️ Web dashboard

After `octop run`, open **http://127.0.0.1:8088**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/readme-chat.png" alt="MediaBuddy Web Dashboard" width="800" />
</p>

- **Chat** — real-time conversation with experts and teams
- **Experts** — create experts, pick templates / MBTI personas, share or publish experts, configure providers
- **AgentTeams** *(Beta)* — coordinator + member experts for multi-step work
- **Connectors** — OAuth apps and MCP gateways
- **Channels** — IM platform setup
- **Cron** — visual cron job management
- **Knowledge base** — manage document corpora, semantic retrieval, and in-deployment sharing
- **Plugins** — install, enable, and configure plugins
- **Remote desktop** — live screen and input from the dashboard
- **ACP** — configure outbound coding-agent runners
- **Settings** — users, security, TLS, system

Interactive API docs: **http://127.0.0.1:8088/api/docs** (disabled by default — enable by setting `"enable_api_docs": true` in `config.json`)

## 📁 Data directory

```
~/.octop/                          ← install & data root
├── config.json                    # process config (optional database section)
├── octop.db                       # SQLite — users, agents, channels, cron, …
├── secrets/                       # JWT secret, channel tokens
├── agents/<agent_id>/             # per-agent workspace (SOUL.md, skills, …)
├── security/tool_guard/           # shell command allow/deny rules
├── logs/                          # runtime logs
├── venv/                          # uv-managed Python (installer layout)
└── bin/octop                      # PATH wrapper → venv/bin/octop
```

The control plane can also use PostgreSQL — set `database` in `config.json`, or `OCTOP_DATABASE_*` / the first-run wizard. With PostgreSQL, agent memory reuses the same DSN by default (per-agent schema); to keep file-based memory, set `"memory": { "backend": { "type": "sqlite" } }` in the agent config. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) and [docs/adr/002-database-backends.md](docs/adr/002-database-backends.md).

See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for env vars and `config.json`.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
OctopServer
 ├─ DatabasePool            SQLite (WAL) or PostgreSQL
 ├─ SharedServices       DI root — every repo + config
 ├─ ExpertCatalog        scans agents/experts/library/ at boot
 ├─ UserManager
 │   └─ HarnessAgentManager (per user)
 │       └─ AgentRuntime (per agent)
 │           ├─ HarnessAgent      Agent runtime (octop-harness)
 │           ├─ HarnessProcessor  IM / UI / cron entry point
 │           ├─ ChannelManager    IM connections (octop-gateway)
 │           └─ CronManager       APScheduler
 └─ FastAPI app (uvicorn)
```

Single process. Restart rebuilds state from the control-plane database (local SQLite by default; PostgreSQL optional).

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md), [docs/adr/001-single-process-model.md](docs/adr/001-single-process-model.md), and [docs/adr/002-database-backends.md](docs/adr/002-database-backends.md).

## 🛠️ Development

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.12+, Node 18+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```bash
# Backend
make install          # pip install -e ".[dev]"
make all              # format-all + lint + typecheck + test (ship bar)

# Frontend (separate terminal)
make dev-frontend     # Vite dev server on :5173 (override with VITE_DEV_PORT)
make build-frontend   # production build → src/octop/dashboard/
cd dashboard && npx tsc -b
```

Individual targets: `make test`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make format`.

## 🔒 Security & privacy

- **Local-first**: Config, chats, workspaces, and credentials live under `~/.octop/` on your machine.
- **Multi-user isolation**: JWT auth with per-user agents and workspaces.
- **PII redaction & tool approval**: sensitive data is redacted before it leaves the workspace, and risky tools or shell commands require explicit approval under the guardrail rules.
- **Tool guardrails**: User-editable shell command rules under `~/.octop/security/tool_guard/`.
- **No vendor lock-in**: Swap LLM providers, storage backends, and channels without rewriting agents.
